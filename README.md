# The jupyter notebooks and python scripts are the underlying code for the manuscript "The Exon Junction Complex coordinates the co-transcriptional inclusion of blocks of neighboring exons".
# Needed input files are generated as described in the Methods section of the manuscript. 
# Many of the notebooks are interdependent - it is best to run them in order of their numbering, to generate the necessary inputs for subsequent scripts.
